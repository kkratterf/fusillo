# ðŸªœ Scale

A spacing scale system streamlines the design of page layouts and user interfaces.

## Base unit

Our spacing system is built around a base unit of 4 pixels. This base unit determines the spacing scale and ensures visual consistency across products.

## Spacing scale

Starting with a 4px base unit, the cornerstone of our spacing strategy is the spacing scale. This scale comprises a select range of space values, specifically designed for arranging UI elements uniformly.

Each value within this scale is derived as a multiple of the 4px base unit. The range extends from 0px up to 384px, providing ample flexibility while ensuring a consistent look and feel across various layout designs.
